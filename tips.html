            <h1>Tips - Starting Out</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Practice singing the languages you want to sing songs for. Not all languages are this flexible, but I highly recommend if a language has a set alphabet (example, Korean, Japanese, etc.) sing the songs in your picked language based on the original reading. For Korean, the language is read through Hangul, so I recommend to learn the hangul alphabet and sing songs based on that alphabet. It will 1) strengthen your Korean reading/speed 2) you will pronounce the syllables more accurately compared to just romanization</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have the basic tools to start: A decent microphone, recording/editing program, and the passion to sing! I actually first started singing with Voice Memos on my iPhone, and I used free programs like Audacity, so you do not need expensive materials to kickstart your hobby<br><br>

                    * I would put links/icons to downloading programs/how to use said programs *</li><br>
                    <li>Join Discord Servers, forum pages, or even keep up with YouTube collab channels where people constantly open collab auditions, drop Google forms for auditions. If you are a beginner singer and want the quickest way to start off your hobby/collab portfolio, I would recommend joining FCFS (First Come First Serve) Collabs where no audition is required and you can pick the part you want. But be mindful of your skill level and make sure you pick parts you know you are capable of!</li>
                    <li>Make good connections/friends with people you’d like to cover with. Especially if you are a coverist in a common music genre everyone likes, it will be easier to bond and make connections with people in the community. You can start off conversations with groups you like!</li>
                    <li>Always be open to feedback and criticisms. Especially if you want to improve singing, always be open to people providing feedback to help you improve. It will help in the long run and help you focus on what you need to work on.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Tips - Audtioning for Collabs</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>There are a few audition clips you can hand in for a collab. From greatest to least desired, these are the types you can send:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A cover of the entire song you are auditioning for. It does not have to be polished/finalized, but if you send an entire song clip where your vocal skills are clearly heard, it will help the host pick the best part for you since they have a full cover to base your voice off of. Bonus points if there are harmonies here and there to showcase your harmonization skills.</li>
                        <li>A collab of the song you are auditoning for where you were casted. Just make sure to send the right timestamp/mention who you were. This kind of clip is a little more limited because you are not showcasing your vocals for the specific song as much.</li>
                        <li>A collab/cover of a song that is not the exact auditioned song, but is similar sound wise. These are accepted in collabing as well, but it makes it slightly more difficult for the host to figure out if you would be a potential fit for the song</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>If you really want to expand your collab portfolio, be as open as you can with parts. Typically mark yourself that you can take any part if you cannot get the parts you want. This will make hosts more open to selecting you</li>
                    <li>If you are able to help with the collab, it will also help your chances. Whether it'd be audio mixing, tuning, timing, or video mixing, a host always appreciates the extra help.</li>
                    <li>Respect the collab, the host, and the deadlines! Be communicative and forward if scheduling issues arise, and do not leave your fellow coverists hanging. It will make hosts less likely to consider you for future collabs</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Tips - Holding Your own Collab</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Make sure you have enough time and energy to conduct a collab. Holding a collab, especially big ones, can be time taxing</li>
                    <li>Be respectful and understanding of coverists you bring into your collab. This is a hobby for a reason, and may not be people's first priorities if other things are going on in life</li>
                    <li>Make sure you can find audio and video mixers early in the process!</li>
                    <li>Be a good host and keep good communication</li>
                </ul>
