            <h1>Tips - Starting Out</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Practice singing the languages you want to cover. Not all languages have an alphabet, but I highly recommend if your desired language has one (Korean, Japanese, etc.) sing the songs in that said alphabet. For example, with Korean, it uses a Hangul alphabet system, so I recommend to learn Hangul and sing/read songs in it. It will strengthen your Korean reading/speed and improve your pronounciation compared to relying on romanization/English alphabet</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have the basic tools to start: A microphone, a recording/editing program, and the passion to sing! I personally started singing with the Voice Memos application on my iPhone, and I used free programs like Audacity, so you do not need expensive ones to kickstart your hobby. Linked below are downloads to some commonly used programs for covering<br><br>

                    </center><br>

                    <li>Join Discord Servers, forum pages, YouTube channels where people open collab auditions, through Google Forms or simply commenting. If you are a beginner and want to start joining collabs quickly, I would recommend joining FCFS (First Come First Serve) Collabs where no audition is required and you can pick the part you want. But be mindful of your skill level and make sure you pick parts you know you are capable of!</li>
                    <li>Make good connections/friends with people you’d like to cover with. Especially since the community you join will have the same music tastes as you, it will be easier to bond and converse.</li>
                    <li>Always be open to feedback and criticism, especially if you want to improve singing. Most coverists are willing to help give feedback even as a hobby as everyone wants to sound their best. It will help you focus on what you need to work on.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Tips - Audtioning for Collabs</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>There are a few audition clips you can hand in for a collab. From greatest to least helpful, these are the clips you can send:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A cover of the entire song you are auditioning for. It does not have to be polished/finalized, but if you send an entire clip where your vocals are clearly heard, it will help the host pick the best part for you since they have a full cover to compare with. Bonus points if there are harmonies here and there to showcase your harmonization skills</li>
                        <li>A collab of the song you are auditoning for where you are in the cast. Just make sure to send the right timestamp/mention who you were. This kind of clip is a more limited for the host to work with because there are less of your vocals to hear.</li>
                        <li>A collab/cover of a song that is not the auditioned song, but is similar sound wise. While they are acceptable, the host has more difficulty figuring out if you would be a potential fit for the song</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>If you really want to expand your collab participation, be as open as you can with parts. Typically mark yourself that you can take any part if your preferred parts are unavailable. This will make hosts more open to selecting you</li>
                    <li>If you are able to help with the collab, it will also help your chances. Whether it'd be audio/video mixing, tuning, or timing, a host always appreciates the extra help and will likely lean towards casting you</li>
                    <li>Respect the collab, the host, and the deadlines! Be communicative and forward if scheduling issues arise, and do not leave your fellow coverists hanging. It will make hosts less likely to consider you for future collabs</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>Tips - Holding Your own Collab</h1>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Make sure you have enough time and energy to conduct a collab. Holding a collab, especially big ones, can be taxing</li>
                    <li>Be respectful and understanding of coverists you cast in your collabs. This is a hobby for a reason, and may not be people's first priorities if other things are going on in their lives</li>
                    <li>Be a good host and keep communication with the coverists</li>
                </ul>
